# Clothing-Store-Simulator

This Java project incorporates loops, array lists, control flow, and object-oriented programming concepts to create
a Clothing Store Simulation. The project includes a user registration/login component and allows the user to interact
with items in the catalogue. This includes the options of selecting items and the quantity of each item, removing items from
the shopping cart, and purchasing items via different payment methods.
